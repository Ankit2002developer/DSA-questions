# [704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/)
<p>
  Given an array of integers <code>nums</code> which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer <code>target</code>, write a function to search <code>target</code> in <code>nums</code>. If <code>target</code> exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return <code>-1</code>.
  
</p>

<p>
  You must write an algorithm with <code>O(log n)</code> runtime complexity.

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
    Output: 4
    Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

    
    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
    Output: -1
    Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
